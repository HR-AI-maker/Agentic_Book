# Skill: Chapter Writer

## Description

Writes comprehensive technical textbook chapters with clear explanations, code examples, and exercises for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.

## When to Use

- Creating new chapters for any module
- Expanding existing content
- Adding code examples and exercises

## How It Works

1. **Research Phase**
   - Review official documentation (ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac, etc.)
   - Identify key concepts to cover
   - Plan code examples

2. **Structure Phase**
   - Create chapter outline
   - Define learning objectives
   - Plan exercises

3. **Writing Phase**
   - Write introduction with learning objectives
   - Explain concepts with increasing complexity
   - Include code examples with explanations
   - Add diagrams where helpful

4. **Code Examples**
   - All code must be tested and working
   - Include comments explaining key parts
   - Show expected output

5. **Exercises**
   - 3-5 exercises per chapter
   - Increasing difficulty
   - Solutions available (hidden by default)

## Quality Criteria

- Clear, accessible language
- All claims supported by documentation
- Code examples tested and working
- Logical progression of concepts
- 2000-4000 words per chapter
